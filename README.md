# Portfolio

This repository contains my Front-end development projects (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React) and will later include DevOps practices such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Purpose

This structure is designed to support iterative learning: small projects, variations, reusable assets, and a clear separation between Front-end and DevOps work. It grows with my skills in a clean, organized, and scalable way.
